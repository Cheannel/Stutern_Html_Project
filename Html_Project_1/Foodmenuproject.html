     <h1>My Favourite Food Menu</h1>
     My favourite meal is Oha soup locally called "ofe oha". It is a local Nigerian meal of the Igbo tradition. 
     The Igbo tradition covers the South eastern part of Nigerian which include states like Abia, Anambra, Imo, 
     Enugu, Ebonyi and some part of Delta state. The people from Anambra mostly refer to it as "Ofe ora", 
     while most people from Imo state call it "Ofe oha". The soup is one of the best traditional type of meal 
     and very popular across their ethnicity.

     <b> My Method of Preparation</b>
<ol>
<li>Provision of all items needed and cleaning of pots</li>
<li>Selecting the oha leaf: Select only fresh parts, avoid picking leaves that ain't oha leaf, 
    then use both hands to cut each leaf into pieces.</li>
<li>Washing of food items: The oha leaf, meat, cocoyam, Banga, fresh pepper, 
    dry fish & stock fish are been rinsed off thoroughly, from soil particles and all other kitchen utensils needed in the cooking.</li>
<li>Boiling: After washing, place the meat, stock fish, inside a pot, add salt based on the quantity, 
    add chopped onion, pepper, and add seasoning cube(s), then place on fire, allow to steam for a few minutes. 
    Boil both cocoyam and banga in another pot, allow to get tender. </li>
<li>Pounding: 
    <ol>
        <li>After boiling the cocoyam and banga for several minutes, add banga into a mortar and pound using a pestle.</li>
        <li>Make hot water available to ease removal of oil, which can be achieved using a sieve placed on the pot for preparing the soup proper.</li>
        <li>Add mashed banga into a sieve, to collect oil and filter the shaft from entering into the pot, after which the pot is placed back on fire to heat.</li>
        <li>Place cocoyam inside the mortar, then mash to a desired state.</li>
    </ol>
<li>Adding of condiments:
    <ol>
       <li>Once the boiling oil gets properly steamed, add mashed fresh pepper, crayfish, dry fish, stir to mix, then allow to boil.</li>
       <li>the steamed meat, and stock fish into the boiling oil, also stir.</li>
       <li>Add mashed cocoyam and allow to boil for several minutes to blend, and increase thickness of the soupüç≤.</li>
       <li>Once mashed cocoyam has boiled properly, stir, add salt, seasoning cubes and taste. Also add the sauce from boiled meat.</li>
    </ol>
<li>Adding of Oha leaf: As soon as the meal has boiled very well, and ready to be brought down, 
    add the leaves that has been cut into smaller pieces, and stir cautiously, then bring down from fire.</li>
